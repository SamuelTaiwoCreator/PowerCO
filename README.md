# PowerCO Electricity Power Consumption
Conducted an in-depth analysis of customer churn for PowerCo, a leading energy utility provider, to identify key drivers of customer attrition. Using the data science methodology, I worked with the client to understand the problem, gathered relevant data, and applied statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover insights. The project aimed to inform strategic decisions to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
Excel was used for data analysis,also jupyter note and python for the editing, insights and visualization
